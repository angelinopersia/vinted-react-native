## This project is a React Native frontend oriented clone of the famous Vinted mobile application

</div>

I've created this project as proof of my frontend skills with limited time and packages required, only resorting to installing navigation and tab packages in order to shorten time spent on the project and obtain better, more efficient results. This way, I was able to take care of most of the important and common parts of the Vinted app's frontend.
